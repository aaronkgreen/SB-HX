10/05/2016 10:54 AKG	CrudAPI.php is feature complete, just need to debug, test and implement an 
				inherrited class and remove some echoes if successful.  I also 
				need to step away and asses feasability as I have some concerns 
				continuing down this route.
10/05/2016 09:27 AKG	Spent some time amending CrudAPI to reflect my original design, be in-line with 
				my research and adhere to best practices.
